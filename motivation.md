# ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

![Become the part of better world!](.gitbook/assets/KLY\_LOGO.png)

Since early ages I'm in love with crypto industry. Among tons of hustlers who are here only because of money & gambling, I(and our [_**@KlyntarTeam**_](https://github.com/klyntarteam)) really appreciate impact of valuable projects which brings improvements to our world. Instead of being 26899_th_ scam NFT or 5684_th we also want to be useful by creating our project. We've started Klyntar with_ [_**@ushkoff**_](https://github.com/ushkoff) at 16 as NewNews, but during development process everyone has been proposing a lot of improvements, so very soon we've decided to replan our initial intentions and create more general propose project.\
\
At the beginning of our initial whitepaper, you can see some kind of disclaimer\
\
_<mark style="color:purple;">Â«...No, itâ€™s not another DeFi shit token,10th generation of Doge clones, Â«amazingÂ» cross-chain bridge or some scam NFT projectÂ»</mark>_\
\
Lack of really technically original projects last years also was a motivation for us to work and present an MVP version of future Goliath. Our goals isn't to sell 10B of premined coins to morons and be 10000th project on CoinMarketCap rates. Our goals is to refresh those spirit of geeks time, like on the edge of crypto projects when literally each month was the birthday of  interesting projects.\
\
In development process we have been using the newest and best available technologies,algorithms and architectural features.\
\
Let's start our journey!\
