# üèõ Social consensus

### <mark style="color:red;">What's this?</mark>

You may have seen this in other projects, but we want to take social consensus mechanisms to a new level. First, let's define the terminology

{% hint style="info" %}
Social consensus - a public and final decision of resource owners on KLYNTAR regarding some issue
{% endhint %}

In KLYNTAR, using the Apollo interface or through third-party services, you can actively participate in the life of the project. This applies to both decision-making at all levels

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Global**</mark>\
  \
  General voting of all interested parties in KLYNTAR - KLY hodlers and tokens, validators, unobtanium holders, host chain miners and validators, representatives of KLYNTAR Services. Here the most important and global issues concerning the entire platform will be resolved\

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Symbiote/Symbiote Group Level**</mark>\
  \
  Only those who have interests and resources at the symbiote level make decisions and have a voice here. These can be some more mundane issues, such as redirecting part of the commission to finance something (charity, supporting an organization), changing a workflow or a set of host chains, and so on.\

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Service/smart contract level**</mark>\
  \
  Interested parties will be able to accept voting at the level of individual services and smart contracts. Here we are talking, for example, about changes in the source code of the service or other local issues

You can take votes directly through Apollo in the Miscellaneous section

### <mark style="color:red;">Hostchain resources in the life of KLYNTAR</mark>

We expect that in KLYNTAR, hostchain resources will also be taken into account when voting. Due to the fact that your equipment works for the security of another PoW cryptocurrency, thanks to the symbiosis, it also turns out that you work for our security. Thus, it will be possible to vote with your Bitcoin blocks, the amount of stakes in Avalanche or Solana, the amount of ZCash liquidity reserves that your addresses supply to KLYNTAR and allow for quantum swaps, and other resources that KLYNTAR considers valuable. For example, the diagram below shows how the amount of unobtanium mined for KLYNTAR by mining Litecoin can be calculated.

Here, for simplicity, the dispute regarding commissions on one of the symbiotes is resolved and only 2 miners take part. Of course, this is an abstraction and the number of sides will be greater. So, for example, here, for 100 blocks, conditional 100 unobtanium units were mined, while 2 voters mined only 4 units out of 100, while the "rest of the network" - 96. By linking your Litecoin addresses to BLS addresses on KLYNTAR, you can vote and confirm ownership of unobtanium.

As mentioned earlier, due to the greater decentralization, voting can also take place using the host chain. Thus, using smart contracts, it will also be possible to take part in the voting.
