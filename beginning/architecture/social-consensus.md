# üèõ Social consensus

### <mark style="color:red;">What's this?</mark>

You may have seen this in other projects, but we want to take social consensus mechanisms to a new level. First, let's define the terminology

{% hint style="info" %}
Social consensus - a public and final decision of resource owners on KLYNTAR regarding some issue
{% endhint %}

In KLYNTAR, using the Apollo interface or through third-party services, you can actively participate in the life of the project. This applies to both decision-making at all levels

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Global**</mark>\
  \
  General voting of all interested parties in KLYNTAR - KLY hodlers and tokens, validators, unobtanium holders, host chain miners and validators, representatives of KLYNTAR Services. Here the most important and global issues concerning the entire platform will be resolved\

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Symbiote/Symbiote Group Level**</mark>\
  \
  Only those who have interests and resources at the symbiote level make decisions and have a voice here. These can be some more mundane issues, such as redirecting part of the commission to finance something (charity, supporting an organization), changing a workflow or a set of host chains, and so on.\

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Service/smart contract level**</mark>\
  \
  Interested parties will be able to accept voting at the level of individual services and smart contracts. Here we are talking, for example, about changes in the source code of the service or other local issues

You can take votes directly through Apollo in the Miscellaneous section

### <mark style="color:red;">Hostchain resources in the life of KLYNTAR</mark>

As mentioned earlier, due to the greater decentralization, voting can also take place using the hostchains. Thus, using smart contracts, it will also be possible to take part in the voting.
