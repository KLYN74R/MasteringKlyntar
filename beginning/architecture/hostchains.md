# üë®üë©üë¶ Hostchains

### <mark style="color:red;">What is considered a hostchain?</mark>

A hostchain is a chain (blockchain) whose security symbiotes rely on. It can be said that this is a carrier chain (host). Depending on the host chain and its capabilities (consensus, the presence of smart contracts, security), symbiotes enter into a variety of relationships with them - from simple storage of commits (roughly speaking, the height + hash of the symbiote) to interactive through smart contracts, following the logic of which it will be impossible to crank malicious actions. The best host chains are those that have smart contracts. This means that you can write an advanced connector for them that will use this smart contract and execute the necessary logic. However, since any chain is public and open (permissionless), you can use its SDK to build connectors of any complexity and functionality.

### <mark style="color:red;">**PoW and PoS host chains. Advantages and disadvantages**</mark>

We have moved on to an important topic. Since all hostchains are different, they all use different consensus algorithms. This is important for KLYNTAR, as it is about what is considered a finalization, whether this host chain can be generally trusted, and so on. The dispute between PoS and PoW supporters has not faded away for a very long time, and each of them is right in its own way. But here we will rather not talk about classical PoW and PoS, but about two large groups of algorithms:

* Those who spend real resources (through mining, wasting memory, time)
* Those who rely on the intrinsic value of their coins (PoS and modifications, various BFTs, etc.)

Some of them offer probabilistic finality, some guarantee instant finalization. Also, often PoS proponents don't like to mention all sorts of long range attacks (when old validators fork and you can't now know which one is valid), although mining also has its own problems. Some (Zilliqa and others) are proposing a hybrid approach where PoW and PoS work together.

Whatever it was, the symbiote needs to choose a set of host chains so that all the risks are taken into account and the disadvantages of both groups of consensus overlap with the advantages of each other. For fast finalization, you should choose fast BFT-based hostchains, and for long-term security, you should choose something from heavy artillery - Bitcoin, mining capacities of other projects, use a combination of Proof-of-Space crypto projects, and so on.

By having certain logic run on the symbiote workflow, you don't have to worry about communication with host chains being expensive or under attack.

For example, in our workflow (workflows) it is planned to make sure that the validators hold the stake between commits to the host chains. Thus, between two interactions with a host chain, security and non-reversion is ensured by the rates of symbiote validators, and after the commit, security is already provided by the host chains.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Let's take an illustrative example**</mark>

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

Suppose that the nodes of some symbiote (here highlighted in blue) have started an interaction session with their host chains and sent the necessary data to them (using the logic of connectors). Let this data get into and be processed in future blocks of the host chain. For various reasons, everyone takes the moment of finalization for himself (somewhere it is enough for you that the commit was included in Bitcoin, and somewhere that smart contracts worked out correctly).

From now on, this is a new non-returning point in the history of the symbiote. Both hostchains on PoW (Bitcoin) and on PoS / BFT (Solana and Avalanche) are used here. The state of the symbiote is protected both by the resources actually spent, and by the value of virtual assets and the value of networks.

However, to speed up + reduce the cost of such interactions, the symbiote interacts with host chains at a selected frequency - once an hour, once a day, and so on. The longer the time between interactions, the longer validators and bidders cannot unlock their bids. Their coins are used as a security deposit.

So, in our example above, the interaction happens in a new block. Let these be blocks A, B and C for Solana, Avalanche and Bitcoin, respectively.

Suppose that all this happened for a block with an index of _<mark style="color:orange;">**100,000**</mark>_ and a hash _<mark style="color:orange;">**adcdef...**</mark>_. In this case, the nodes sign this data and publish their signatures.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

We used multi-signatures here, which you will get acquainted with here, but for now let them be a kind of black box for you that will collect signatures and public keys of validators and aggregate them into a single proof.

As we can see above, the nodes have signed and now security and non-rollback are ensured by:

* Hostchains
* Signers on KLYNTAR

In this case, the signers' security budget is 60,000 KLY, but in general, you understand that it will be more. Moreover, workflow features are also the fact that not only direct validators can bet on the symbiote block. Third-party stakers don't even need to know what's inside - their job is to ensure the existence of a single valid chain.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**What's next?**</mark>

Since we are efficient, from block 100,000 until the next day (assuming the symbiote saves data to the host chains once a day), security is provided by the symbiote's nodes and other signers.

They work extremely fast, generating many blocks per second (thanks to phantom blocks, which you will learn about in the next section) following the rules of their workflow.

Each block is signed in the same way as shown above, and the proof is also distributed over the network.

During the entire period between commits to the host chains, the stakes of the signers are frozen. Thus, if necessary, they can be slashed and, if there is evidence that one of the validators signed a different version of the symbiote blocks, to deprive him of his bet.

In our example, it turns out that those who have frozen rates will not be able to unfreeze them for 1 day. As soon as the time for a new interaction session comes, the set of validators can be changed. You, if necessary, unfreeze your bet and leave with the interest earned, and other signers can be appointed in your place.

### <mark style="color:red;">Hivemind</mark>

Hivemind is the future of KLYNTAR's hostchain enhancements. In short, the symbiotes will exchange data with each other and ensure their safety and the safety of other symbiotes by measuring the block generation time in different host chains (for the fastest possible finalization). Also, it will favorably affect the fact that interactions with host chains will become cheaper and faster.

### <mark style="color:red;">Methods of interaction with host chains</mark>

Symbiotes interact with host chains using connectors or APIs. Such interaction occurs both at the workflow level and at the service level (KLYNTAR Services).

Maturing question

> Does this mean that I will need to run hostchain nodes???

No, don't worry, everything is cooler and more interesting here. Yes, in order to interact with host chains within workflow and KLYNTAR Services, you will need to somehow communicate with other blockchains.

Here is an example connector for EVM chains

It can be seen that here the Web3 module needs an endpoint address. Similar can be found in other connectors.

Here it is - if you have a node - use it, otherwise you have a whole range of possibilities:

* Use Node-as-a-Service Services
* Use public (but trusted) nodes
* Use nodes that can be rented out by those who have them

This way you can get started quickly without using your own resources. However, you should be careful - if you need to sign something on KLYNTAR after verification from the host chain, then with false data from a malicious source, you risk losing your money.
