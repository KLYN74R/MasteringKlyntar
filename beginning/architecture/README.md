# üèó Architecture

### <mark style="color:red;">Content</mark>

In the following sections, you will learn about how KLYNTAR works, its components, architecture, workflows, and so on. We will try to give both a good general idea and dive into some details so that you can easily start studying further sections.

It is also worth warning that KLYNTAR may seem complicated to you initially, but in our world everything works like that. Computers, economics, physics - all this is difficult to some extent, but only because there are great opportunities behind it.

If you have any difficulty understanding, do not hesitate to ask us questions. We also expect you to actively participate in the development and development of the project.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It should also be warned that this version of MasteringKlyntar is introductory to the start of the project, so you will often come across sections with Coming Soon or incomplete material. We will supplement and update the book as the project develops.
