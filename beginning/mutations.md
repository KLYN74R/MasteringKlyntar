# ðŸ§¬ Mutations

### <mark style="color:red;">What is the mutation principle in KLYNTAR?</mark>

Thanks to the symbiotic structure and the presence of many chains, it becomes possible to apply partial changes that will be useful for the entire network as a whole. The largest and clearest example is workflow - each symbiote can work following some kind of its own consensus, have its own set of host chains, determine the type of interaction with them, and much more.

Services also have the freedom to use technology. Each runner can be custom, connectors are also custom. From symbiote to symbiote, their own settings for the KLYNTAR VM virtual machine can be applied, the functionality can be expanded, you can create your own tables for estimating the cost of smart contracts and much more.

The default sharding structure allows you to dynamically pick up your hardware - you can support 1 symbiote, 2 or even 10. You can run them on the same node, on different ones, you can set up custom filters, extend the infrastructure with plugins, decide to start services depending on your opportunities.

Interaction with other chains (hostchains) gives you the opportunity to use your nodes from Litecoin, Polygon, Secret and other crypto projects for your own work - for services, your nodes, and so on, or participate in trust pools and provide information about other chains to some other symbiotes, your friend and so on.

The independence of services contributes to their fast, asynchronous, and most importantly cheap off-chain operation. You only need to set up the equipment and the rules of the game, and then just watch how your balance increases.

Mutations allow KLYNTAR to be more powerful than other projects and always remain important and in demand
