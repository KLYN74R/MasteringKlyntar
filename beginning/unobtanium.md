# üõ∏ Unobtanium

### <mark style="color:red;">Introduction</mark>

One of the greatest films in history, James Cameron's Avatar gives us an idea for the name of our next invention for KLYNTAR.

> _<mark style="color:red;">**Unobtanium**</mark>_ is a fantastic mineral, an extremely rare and valuable superconductor mined on Pandora and which will be the main driving force for KLYNTAR and the crypto industry.

First of all, this is not gas on the EVM or some kind of asset. You can get it from anywhere, but you can also lose it everywhere - literally. When I started this document, I told you that a symbiotic relationship will help us exploit all available crypto spaces.

But we can take more from different chains - I mean full integration! In the beginning, let's talk about shared resources, how to get them, how it is implemented, what it means and specifically - where and how to use it.

### <mark style="color:red;">**What's this?**</mark>

Unobtanium is a set of different combinations of resources from different blockchains for maximum decentralization and efficiency ratio.

Imagine that you have 1 BTC, 10 DOT and are also a validator on Binance Smart Chain. Why not combine these facts to create a bit of unobtanium? üòâ Thus, it is too difficult to influence the network in terms of a single resource when it is not only driven by hashrate power or bet size. KLYNTAR is designed to be a homogeneous space of the crypto industry and bring together features, resources, decentralization, TPS, reputation and other features from different crypto projects. We can visualize it like this

Speaking of decentralization, we usually mean the impact on the network through the size of the stake, the hashrate power, the size of the delegated coins, and so on. But the reality is that the hashrates of PoW cryptocurrencies are controlled by multiple pools. Coins built on staking systems (such as various forms of PoS-PPoS, LPoS, DPoS) are also placed on a small percentage of addresses. At the same time, these projects sell their coins to some ‚Äúprivate investors‚Äù or ‚Äúon pre-sale‚Äù, and you don‚Äôt know who owns 20% of the coins that have been inactive since the launch of this cryptocurrency.

Instead of sharing one resource and relying on a "well decentralized" distribution, we allow people to pool their resources from different chains - UTXO, stakes, reputation, the fact that your address is a validator somewhere, the fact that you mined blocks and combinations such as staking on BSC & total SHIBA tokens burned on ETH contract, validator role on Polygon & stake on TRON & validator on Polkadot and so on.

### <mark style="color:red;">**What are the advantages of such an approach?**</mark>

1. Increasing the KLYNTAR security budget
2. Securing Host Chains
3. Continued interest in KLYNTAR

### <mark style="color:red;">**Examples**</mark>

Below is an example of how your Bitcoin holdings can be converted to Unobtanium on KLYNTAR

As noted in the NOTE section, there may be several options that will give you different amounts of Unobtanium.

For example, older entries will be more valuable than new ones due to the longer hodl period. The longer you hold, the more unobtanium can be obtained on KLYNTAR. This is due to the fact that the security of Bitcoin, among other things, rests on hodlers who do not sell coins, but believe in its long-term growth.

KLYNTAR is just beneficial because if Bitcoin ceases to exist, then we will lose perhaps the most reliable and large-scale PoW chain. The situation is similar with other crypto projects.

It is also worth mentioning that in new versions you will not even need to make transactions and spend money on commissions. With ValarDohaeris, you can simply import your hostchain private key into Apollo and generate a simple proof for the network. Then, you will be able to "bind" your unobtanium to KLYNTAR-supported addresses
{% endhint %}

Here is another example - this time Ethereum. Thanks to the capabilities of smart contracts, it is possible to build even more flexible schemes.

For example, here we can assume that we will offer some kind of token as part of an advertising campaign to some kind of symbiote
