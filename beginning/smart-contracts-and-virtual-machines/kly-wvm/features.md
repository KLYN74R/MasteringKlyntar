# ðŸª„ Features

## <mark style="color:red;">Sharded(low-level sharding implementation)</mark>

Since the native KLY chain (kNULL) is sharded, all shards will have the same chainID(for KLY-EVM) and symbioteID(for KLY-WVM), despite the fact that individual accounts that are linked to a particular subchain are stored in the same database

## <mark style="color:red;">Post-quantum secured</mark>

Leverage the power of post-quantum cryptography from the JavaScript environment using a magic address in the WVM

## <mark style="color:red;">Free WVM calls</mark>

KLY will allow you to call WVM for free. It will be possible to build advanced schemes such as several free calls per day, free calls depending on the target contract, free calls based on your role on KLY and so on

## <mark style="color:red;">Storage-by-subscription model</mark>

We plan to introduce a subscription system on the WVM storage so that only those who really benefit from it can use the decentralized benefits of KLY. Very interesting innovation

## <mark style="color:red;">External storage</mark>

It will be possible to use external storage when working with smart contracts

## <mark style="color:red;">EVM compatible</mark>

Call WASM from EVM and vice versa! Write EVM logic using WASM and benefit from hybrid smart contracts(details [<mark style="color:red;">**here**</mark>](https://docs.klyntar.org/smart-contracts/kly-evm/magic-address))

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow the link to learn about using the KLY-EVM magic address to access KLY-WVM and the native environment (Node.js). For WVM, the same principle will be used - calling an external function to access KLY-EVM and native JS environment features
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:red;">Inbuilt powerful oracles</mark>

Call any internet API, use VRF and other powerful abilities of oracles. It will also be possible to modify existing oracles to suit your needs.

## <mark style="color:red;">Interact with codeless smart-contracts by UVM</mark>

Powerful feature of KLY. Your WVM contract using oracles will be able to track RWX contracts whose work is being done in the real world

## <mark style="color:red;">Pay fees in tokens</mark>

Advanced KLY-EVM will allow you to pay transaction fees not with native KLY coins, but with various stablecoins, NFTs, asset-wrapped coins, and so on!

## <mark style="color:red;">Choose fee payer</mark>

The recipient, a third-party smart contract, and so on will be able to pay commissions for you!

## <mark style="color:red;">**Many langs support**</mark>

We plan to enable write and create in many languages that support compiling to WASM
