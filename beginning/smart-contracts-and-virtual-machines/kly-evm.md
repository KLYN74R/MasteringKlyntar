Well, yes, what did you think?!) KLYNTAR will allow symbiotes to use the EVM, write their own additional functions before running the EVM logic, make free calls (sandbox calls), make calls between virtual machines (cross-VM-calls), use free oracles from KLYNTAR and use heavy-duty functionality. In addition, thanks to the post-quantum capabilities of KLYNTAR, this functionality will also be extrapolated to the EVM!

## <mark style="color:red;">Separate repository for general updates and improvements</mark>

KLYNTAR EVM (KLY-EVM) will be available for everyone to use and improve. Here is a link to the repository we are working on

Any symbiote or standalone project can use this repository as a dependency.

In addition, using some workarounds, you can write EVM functionality not only in Solidity, but also using other familiar languages - Rust, C, Python, Go, and more!

## <mark style="color:red;">What else is available?</mark>

Also, we have not forgotten about RPC. A JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation has already been written for KLY-EVM, which adds KLY-EVM compatibility with tools such as the web3 library, various wallets (Metamask) and other tools.

You can also use this repository as a dependency in your project

A flexible configuration tree is available here in which you can configure the chain ID, default gas price, set limits and more.

<mark style="color:red;">**KLY-EVM**</mark> will be used in the original kNULL symbiote
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:red;">Additionally</mark>

We invite all projects that currently exist in EVM-compatible chains to launch on KLYNTAR as well. Here you will get the fastest, safest and the most decentralized version of EVM with advanced functionality, lower (or even zero) gas prices and many other features!

If you are a DEX project, oracle network, NFT marketplace or any other project - welcome!
