Today, the need for smart contracts in blockchains is actually mandatory, because it allows you to write custom logic in the form of contracts that then live and executed in a decentralized environment.

At KLY we try to be as versatile as possible to allow you to quickly and easily start writing anything for KLYNTAR. That is why we provide developers with the opportunity to create smart contracts with amazing features that are available exclusively on KLY.

So, on KLY there will be such opportunities for creating decentralized logic:

* <mark style="color:red;">**KLY-WVM**</mark> - WASM-based virtual machine with wide support of several languages, tons of extensions, cross-VM calls to KLY-EVM, etc.
* <mark style="color:red;">**KLY-EVM**</mark> - EVM compatible VM with tons of features like sharding, storage-by-subscription model, fees in tokens, improved opcodes logic, cross-VM calls to KLY-WVM, etc.
* <mark style="color:red;">**UVM**</mark> - Universal Virtual Machine. Absctract VM which allow you to create DApps 2.0, interact with network, call inbuild oracles system, create & use Docker containers, create codeless smart-contracts with real-world execution and much more!
