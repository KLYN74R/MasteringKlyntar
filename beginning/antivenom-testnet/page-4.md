### <mark style="color:red;">Fast testnet for local testing</mark>

We have also compiled an all-in-one repository for you, which describes the process of launching a local testnet with a single and several nodes (depending on the workflow).

The advantage is that you don't have to do anything what can cause complications - misconfigs, data problems and so on.

Here is the repository

The README has a detailed and step-by-step description of the steps. All you need to do is clone this repository and run a single script inside. This script will do all the work for you - it will take an example of configs for the required workflow, download all dependencies, run the necessary builds.

Ultimately, you will have a working local version of the network that can be used for testing and personal needs.
