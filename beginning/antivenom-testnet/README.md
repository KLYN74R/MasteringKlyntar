# üëæ Antivenom(testnet)

### <mark style="color:red;">**Briefly about the main**</mark>

A mandatory partner of any blockchain project is a testnet. This, as you probably know, is a testing ground, a testing ground where new features, changes and mechanisms are tested.

Testnets can be classified by scale:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Local**</mark>\
  \
  Usually a small network of 1 node on your local network. It usually runs on the same host from where it interacts with it. Key feature - small, for local testing\

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Semi-private**</mark>\
  \
  It can be a network where individual nodes or organizations can join. The reason for the creation may be testing of some project and so on.\

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Public**</mark>\
  \
  Public nodes that form a common network (in this case, a symbiote) and provide access to the API for working with the network. Usually launched by developers or a group of enthusiasts

We want to give you easy access to the entire powerful KLYNTAR arsenal. That is why you can easily set up testnets of any access level and apply various features - your own workflow, integration with hostchain testnets, access to service test environments, and so on.

Experience with other chains in general gave us an idea of what developers would like when they start working with the ecosystem.

### <mark style="color:red;">Tutorial plan</mark>

As part of our short tutorial, we will show you how to create a local testnet in a couple of minutes, tell you about the flexibility of configurations, the use of plugins, and so on. Of course it is difficult to fit all the power into a small amount of text, but remember that you can always ask for help from the community!

Let's help each other and be open ‚ù§Ô∏è
