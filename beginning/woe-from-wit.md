### <mark style="color:red;">Crypto in 2k22, hustle culture and 1001 ideas</mark>

I'm sure if you're reading this, it means that you're probably interested in the latest in our field in one way or another. We do not care if you are a developer, an investor, a crypto enthusiast or an SEC agent. I think we will be able to convey to you the beauty of the decisions and developments made and the "gigantism" of thoughts.

Again, as mentioned earlier, due to close acquaintance with the technical characteristics of other projects, our head was spinning - after all, how can we surprise users, if it would seem that so much is already available - all sorts of DeFi, DEX, NFT marketplaces, cross-chains and other. Because of this, I had to spend a lot of time searching for tricky solutions that no one had thought of yet, choosing the best ones between different algorithms (for example, for generating key pairs, hashing, KEX mechanisms, etc.). What about by consensus? Your own solution or take a proven one? PoS or something based on real resources? What about scalability? Should we try to overtake Solana or focus on something else? How to solve the problems of PoS finalization, which has recently become more and more popular in conjunction with BFT mechanisms and (which is a pity for us) is replacing PoW with its "real resources"?

All this is just a part of the questions that arise in the minds of blockchain developers at the design stage. It becomes more difficult when it comes to implementation. Here one plan can replace another, then it turns out that the consensus you have chosen turns out to be absolutely not scalable in practice, and algorithms that yesterday still seemed good to you today already graze the backs of some new NIST "favorites".

With this text, we want to show that KLYNTAR was born in discussions, in the abyss of brainstorms and constantly changed to meet the necessary requirements. In the end, as a result, you are reading this document, which means that we still managed to create _<mark style="color:red;">**Frankenstein's monster**</mark>_, and now you will learn how.

### <mark style="color:red;">But in a nutshell, what do you mean?</mark>

I could answer here with the words of Newton from Silicon Valley, they say

> _<mark style="color:purple;">**You can't delve into smth quickly. To delve means to read carefully and scrupulously**</mark>_

However, before starting reading serious docks further, I will still clarify
