# üõ∏ Unobtanium

### <mark style="color:red;">Introduction</mark>

One of the greatest films in history, James Cameron's Avatar gives us an idea for the name of our next invention for KLYNTAR.

> _<mark style="color:red;">**Unobtanium**</mark>_ is a fantastic mineral, an extremely rare and valuable superconductor mined on the planet Pandora. For us, it is also a valuable resource mined on other blockchains to ensure the life of KLYNTAR. We need unobtanium to provide the maximum security budget for KLYNTAR, as well as for the highest possible decentralized distribution of resources.

First, this is not gas on the EVM or some kind of asset. You can get it from anywhere, but you can also lose it everywhere - literally. When I started this document, I told you that a symbiotic relationship will help us exploit all available crypto spaces.

But we can take more from different chains - I mean full integration! In the beginning, let's talk about shared resources, how to get them, how it is implemented, what it means and specifically - where and how to use it.

### <mark style="color:red;">**What's this?**</mark>

Unobtanium is a set of different combinations of resources from different blockchains for maximum decentralization and efficiency ratio.

Imagine that you have 1 BTC, 10 DOT or 100 ADA. Why not combine these facts to create a bit of unobtanium? üòâ Thus, it is too difficult to influence the network in terms of a single resource when it is not only driven by hashrate power or bet size. KLYNTAR is designed to be a homogeneous space of the crypto industry and bring together features, resources, decentralization, TPS, reputation and other features from different crypto projects.

Speaking of decentralization, we usually mean the impact on the network through the size of the stake, the hashrate power, the size of the delegated coins, and so on. But the reality is that the hashrates of PoW cryptocurrencies are controlled by multiple pools. Coins built on staking systems (such as various forms of PoS-PPoS, LPoS, DPoS) are also placed on a small percentage of addresses. At the same time, these projects sell their coins to some ‚Äúprivate investors‚Äù or ‚Äúon pre-sale‚Äù, and you don‚Äôt know who owns 20% of the coins that have been inactive since the launch of this cryptocurrency.

Instead of sharing one resource and relying on a "well decentralized" distribution, we allow people to pool their resources from different chains - bitcoins, ethers, NFTs and so on.

### <mark style="color:red;">**What are the advantages of such an approach?**</mark>

1. Increasing the KLYNTAR security budget to trillions of dollars
2. You can keep holding your NFTs, bitcoins and in the same time - be validator on KLY
3. Continued interest in KLYNTAR
