# 🏅 Best practices

### <mark style="color:red;">**What and why?**</mark>

We will create a separate repository for different developers and enthusiasts to offer their infrastructure options and share these ideas and knowledge with others

{% embed url="https://github.com/KLYN74R/BestPractises" %}

Here, other developers will tell you how best to configure their nodes, how to deploy a cluster, which plugins are recommended to be installed, and so on. Activity here will also be taken into account when voting for community rewards

{% hint style="info" %}
This page, like others, will be updated over time
{% endhint %}
