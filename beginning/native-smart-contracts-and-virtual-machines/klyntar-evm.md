# ðŸ”® KLYNTAR EVM

### <mark style="color:red;">**Coming soon**</mark> ðŸ‘»

Yes, baby, KLYNTAR will allow symbiotes use EVM machines, write custom extra-functionality before to run VM logic, make free calls, make cross-VM calls, use free oracles by KLYNTAR, and use super powerful functionality.

Also, it's a super good feature, because we'll invite popular DEXes, oracles projects and so on to occupy KLYNTAR and join our family!
