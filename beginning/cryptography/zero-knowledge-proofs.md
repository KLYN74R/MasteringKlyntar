# ðŸ¤” Zero Knowledge Proofs

## <mark style="color:red;">zkSNARK on KLYNTAR</mark>

We understand the importance of using zero-knowledge cryptography in various areas and strive for full integration with existing and new solutions.

Since KLYNTAR has a modular architecture and support for both WASM and EVM compatible virtual machines (and others in the future), you can use existing solutions to write your contracts and services using zkSNARK technologies. Moreover, thanks to mutations on KLYNTAR, you can call zk contracts on the EVM from WASM and vice versa, use off-chain features and much more! Check out the libraries and repositories below that you will need to get started. All of them have good documentation, a rating on GitHub, a community of developers and are used in other projects. We recommend that you follow the guidelines and recommendations.

## <mark style="color:red;">**Circom**</mark>

Circom is a special language that can be used to write logic that will then be used to build R1CS, verification keys and more. The new version of the compiler is written in Rust. The documentation has a sufficient number of examples and step-by-step explanations of what needs to be done to create zero-knowledge logic.

## <mark style="color:red;">**SnarkJS**</mark>

SnarkJS can be used to perform a trusted configuration ceremony, generate a verifier Solidity contract, and much more.

More information can be found on the official websites. Below you will see links to repositories that will help you create your own zero-knowledge project.
