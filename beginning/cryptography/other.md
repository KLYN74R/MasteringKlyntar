We are committed to modifying and improving KLYNTAR and therefore expect Cryptoland updates. Updates will take place both on symbiotes and on individual services.

Everyone will be able to build their own ZKP DApp 2.0, use the latest in the world of cryptography - bulletproofs for proving range entry, STARK mechanisms, verifiable encryption, proxy signatures, homomorphic hashing, post-quantum security mechanisms, verifiable delay functions (VDF) and more.

The world of cryptography is amazing and we are going to make the most of it by providing services to people in a way that is understandable and easy to use.

This page will be updated with new information over time. Join the development of KLYNTAR
