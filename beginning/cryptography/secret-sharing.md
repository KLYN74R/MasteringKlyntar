### <mark style="color:red;">**Feldman Verifiable Secret Shares**</mark>

Secret Sharing Schemes - A cryptographic primitive that allows some user to share a secret S among N other users. At the same time, none of them alone can restore the secret. This will only be possible when T out of N users have exchanged their parts.

Depending on the algorithm, they can be verifiable (this is when the participants in the division will have cryptographic proof that their part is the real part of the shared secret)
