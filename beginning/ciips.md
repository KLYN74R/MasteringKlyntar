# üìà CIIPs

To suggest changes and improvements, we have created a separate repository. There are already some suggestions there and using them you can offer your own according to a similar template.

### <mark style="color:red;">**We appreciate your work**</mark>

We undertake to transfer part of the commissions to developers and active users. The decision will be made only by the community within the framework of social consensus. Additionally, we certainly do not prohibit if individual symbiotes or services on KLYNTAR see fit to sponsor individual developers or teams. Everyone's contribution is importantüëç

Stay tuned for updates and more information on this. The page will be updated as the project grows
