### <mark style="color:red;">**We appreciate your work**</mark>

We undertake to transfer part of the commissions to developers and active users. The decision will be made only by the community within the framework of social consensus. Additionally, we certainly do not prohibit if individual symbiotes or services on KLYNTAR see fit to sponsor individual developers or teams. Everyone's contribution is importantüëç

{% hint style="info" %}
Stay tuned for updates and more information on this. The page will be updated as the project grows
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:red;">CIIP-X and mutations</mark>

In previous parts you learn more about Mutations principle. Mutations allow KLY ecosystem to implement features and improvements instantly, even they are in conflict.

The CIIP-X is a special improvement proposal which propose to use mutations for improvement proposals. For this you can use containerization technologies like Docker to propose your feature to network and make available instantly to be used by all the products/services in KLY ecosystem.
