# 🍄 MegaMycelium

{% hint style="warning" %}
Status - <mark style="color:purple;">**Not Started**</mark>
{% endhint %}

As part of this release, we plan to release an application (or in the form of other software) for different platforms so that KLYNTAR justifies its slogan

{% hint style="info" %}
🌌We are everywhere🌌
{% endhint %}

It's too early to tell, but the implementation of the kernel client for different platforms will be an important milestone in the development of KLYNTAR. Working light clients that will perform simpler tasks than the nodes themselves, but nevertheless - all this will be a big plus for decentralization because your tablets, smartphones or even single-payers will be able to store files and data within Lokapala, conduct partial monitoring of host chains, validate services and much more
