Pandora is the planet from the movie "Avatar", where the Na'vi race lives and where mankind mines Unobtanium. We agree that this release will be the most valuable because it will bring the Unobtanium market to KLYNTAR. Simply put, imagine there are two miners - a Dash miner and a Bitcoin miner. Both generated 10 blocks each and want to validate it on KLYNTAR to get Unobtanium (and thus increase their influence). Definitely, we cannot equate them, because these are different prices, difficulties, and so on. And how do you evaluate completely different Unobtanium sources like 10,000 Matic and your place as a validator on Binance Smart Chain? Therefore, to deal with this, we need such an update
