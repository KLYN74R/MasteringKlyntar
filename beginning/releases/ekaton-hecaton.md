Due to the fact that KLYNTAR is a serious project that works with many networks and requires a high level of security outside the network, we came up with this release in order to introduce security mechanisms for your nodes, clusters, gateway APIs and more.

More specifically, we will introduce a number of plugins for the node control panel, implement Remote signing technology, and much more.

Later we will tell you more about the release
