In the first KLYNTAR document (_<mark style="color:red;">**Whitepaper v1**</mark>_), we promised to add only post-quantum signatures based on hashes.

This release can be considered overdone because we have added entire sections of post-quantum algorithms for general use. Both signature mechanisms and key exchange mechanisms, asymmetric encryption, and some others have been added. In addition, all of them are built on the basis of different bases (and not just on the basis of hashes) which are considered to be quantum-resistant.

You can see these algorithms in our Cryptoland repository
