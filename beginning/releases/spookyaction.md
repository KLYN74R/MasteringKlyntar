One of the most important updates for KLYNTAR. In quantum mechanics, ghost action was named by Einstein to describe the interaction between entangled particles at a distance. Because of the correlation between particles (eg photons, positrons, etc.), he could not explain how information could be transmitted between them even across billions of light years instantly. Although this is impossible and scientists have found an explanation for this, we borrowed a few fundamental pillars - "at a distance" and "instantly".

Allowing transactions to take place on other chains can also be helpful in increasing TPS. And although KLYNTAR already has a high TPS, still for global dominance, using the asynchronous operation of your wallets and commits in other chains will allow you to make transactions, execute smart contracts and interact with services faster than ever.

Other chains serve as a kind of safe place in the non-rollback of which you have no doubt and whose security budget suits you and the other participant in the transaction. The changes will then be carried out on KLYNTAR.
