This release will support various address formats for leading crypto projects. Thus, you will be able to work with your BTC, ETH, XRP address formats. Since KLYNTAR provides interoperability with different networks, such features can be useful in case of interoperability and promotion programs.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have already partially implemented this at the Apollo level. Soon you will be able to transfer your Unobtanium to KLYNTAR using VD capabilities
{% endhint %}

### **What it looks like in Apollo**

In Apollo, you can generate addresses, as well as sign messages with a pair of keys, thus confirming the ownership of resources in other networks. So, for example, you can transfer your Bitcoin blocks to some BLS address and manage resources using multi-signatures, or confirm that you are a Polygon validator and turn your blocks into unobtanium to a post-quantum address
