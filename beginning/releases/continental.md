An issue that, by title, refers us to John Wick and the Continental Hotel

As we remember, this is a shelter - it is forbidden to conduct any "business" on the territory of the hotel, including fights and fulfilling contracts with other killers in the hotel. There is something in common in our further ideas and proposals.

This is probably a less technical release than all the others, but brings interesting innovations to KLYNTAR. To prepare for it, we will need to do some research and social media work, and build a community to cause a massive effect on Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms. In short, we plan to collect the addresses of different countries and their departments (that is, intelligence agencies, financial institutions, ministries, etc.) in order to pay them some kind of tax to protect our influence around the world. Thus, we envision faster adoption of cryptocurrencies everywhere. Being something more than a regular cryptocurrency, they may very well have some control over KLYNTAR. As soon as any country shows bad behavior or works against cryptocurrency, we can change the balance of taxes and start sponsoring their opponents. On a geopolitical scale, these moves can be critical because they are additional resources for our lobbyists to hire better lawyers, buy more advanced technology, hire military units, run different levels of overseas operations, so in this way we just let you get involved. in that. Thanks to Unobtanium, we will work not only for ourselves - this is how we will help our industry as a whole. Different symbiotes can choose their own strategy, and only after voting can something be realized. By the way, symbiotes do not have to pay all the time - we assume the appearance of some long-term stable external force that will protect us and destroy all enemies.
