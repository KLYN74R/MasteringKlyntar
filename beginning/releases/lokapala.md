# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Lokapala

{% hint style="success" %}
Status - <mark style="color:purple;">**A decision was made to develop the release as a service, and not as a native part of the kernel. This is necessary for greater flexibility, in particular - in the issue of using mobile devices.**</mark>

Like Hindu Peace Guardians, these Guardians will be a repository accessible to any blockchain providing subscription capabilities, access control, persistent proof of availability, proof of replication, and can be one source of Unobtanium (via Proof of SpaceTime). They will also store the symbiote data, so even with only a hash on the host chains, you will also have access to the data in plain text through the Lokapala providers. So, while being useful to the crypto industry and getting coins from your vaults, you can also get Unobtanium and use it wherever you need!
