This release will provide an opportunity for symbiotes to interact with each other at various levels - from quantum swaps to partial checks. Critical release with multiple symbiotes. More details will be discussed in the future in the form of a separate article on our resources.

Here we will describe the mechanism of the trust market, describe the mechanisms for the rational use of nodes of other chains, the principle of spot checks, and so on.

This release will also be useful for those who want to connect their blockchain to existing symbiotes for existence and interaction in a single environment.
